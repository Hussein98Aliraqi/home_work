/////sorry,i can not take screenshot of this excution becuase i can not started my linux we calling by :

ubintu..(any thing)...$gcc -o hussein hussein.c
ubintu..(any thing)...$gcc -o khudiar khudiar.c
ubintu..(any thing)...$./hussein
We are in Hussien.c
ProcessID of hussein.c = number///////number has equals the process id we take from getpid()
We are in khudiar.c
ProcessID of khudiar.c = number//////number is the Same number as above because processor interrupt excution of hussein program and start excution khudiar program 
x in second program = 10
//end
